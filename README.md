# Endpoint Code Challenge

### `yarn && yarn start`

## Notes

I didn't have enough time to make it through the entire solution because I probably wasted too much time configuring things I didn't get TOO much use out off, but the project does have JEST running and it's using the file system.

I also sunk a little too much time into attempting to write my code as declaratively as possibly, where a solution that tackled all features required would have likely used a simple for loop to recursively traverse through the tree.

That said, the create and list methods are functional, just not tested.

Please let me know if you have any questions around the implementations.
